# Deploy Azure AD Connect
Azure AD Connect will integrate your on-premises directories with Azure Active Directory
Azure AD Connect provides the following features:
- Password hash synchronization. A sign-in method that synchronizes a hash of a users on-premises AD password with Azure AD.
- Pass-through authentication. A sign-in method that allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud, but doesn't require the additional infrastructure of a federated environment.
- Federation integration. Federation is an optional part of Azure AD Connect and can be used to configure a hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure. It also provides AD FS management capabilities such as certificate renewal and additional AD FS server deployments.
- Synchronization. Responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects. As well as, making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups is matching the cloud. This synchronization also includes password hashes.
- Health Monitoring. Azure AD Connect Health can provide robust monitoring and provide a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect Health provides robust monitoring of your on-premises identity infrastructure. It enables you to maintain a reliable connection to Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Online Services. This reliability is achieved by providing monitoring capabilities for your key identity components. Also, it makes the key data points about these components easily accessible. Azure AD Connect Health helps you:
- Monitor and gain insights into AD FS servers, Azure AD Connect, and AD domain controllers.
- Monitor and gain insights into the synchronizations that occur between your on-premises AD DS and Azure AD.
- Monitor and gain insights into your on-premises identity infrastructure that is used to access Microsoft 365 or other Azure AD applications

# Explore Authentication options
### Cloud authentication
When you choose this authentication method, Azure AD handles users' sign-in process. Coupled with seamless single sign-on (SSO), users can sign in to cloud apps without having to reenter their credentials. With cloud authentication, you can choose from two options:
**Option 1: Azure AD password hash synchronization.** The simplest way to enable authentication for on-premises directory objects in Azure AD. Users can use the same username and password that they use on-premises without having to deploy any additional infrastructure. Some premium features of Azure AD, like Identity Protection and Azure AD Domain Services, require password hash synchronization, no matter which authentication method you choose.
**Option 2: Azure AD Pass-through Authentication.** Provides a simple password validation for Azure AD authentication services by using a software agent that runs on one or more on-premises servers. The servers validate the users directly with your on-premises Active Directory, which ensures that the password validation doesn't happen in the cloud. Companies with a security requirement to immediately enforce on-premises user account states, password policies, and sign-in hours might use this authentication method.
### Federated authentication
When you choose the Federated authentication method, Azure AD hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system, such as on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), to validate the userâ€™s password.
The authentication system can provide additional advanced authentication requirements. Examples are smartcard-based authentication or third-party multifactor authentication.
